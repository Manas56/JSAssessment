1. javascriptBeginners.js : In this, we learnt about how the NFTs are created, the process of creating the variable holding NFTs,
their metadata and how those NFTs will get minted and the total number of NFTs which are being supplied.    


JavaScript code present in this project defines a simple NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collection. It initializes an empty array NFTS to store NFT objects. The mintNFT function adds a new NFT object with specified properties (name, eye color, shirt type, bling) to the collection. The listNFTS function iterates through the collection and logs each NFT's details. The getTotalSupply function logs the total number of NFTs in the collection. Four NFTs are minted with different properties, and then the list of NFTs and the total supply are logged.

                                                                   
2. ethBeginners.sol :This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on  the Ethereum blockchain.This program can be easily compiled using using Remix IDE.In this contract, we create our own                       token and can also know whichaddress containshow much amount of token, how much amount of token gets minted or burnt                         and what is the total supply of the token available.

This Solidity contract implements a token named "Meta" (symbol: "Mta") with an initial total supply of 0. It provides functions to mint new tokens and burn existing ones, along with basic balance tracking.
